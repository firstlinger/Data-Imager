# Data-Imager
Just A simple data Visualizer. Literally.

You can visualize any kind of file as a image by using this tool.

This is just for fun. There's no practical way of using this tool, I think.

You can contribute to this project for other people looking fun things.

# To use
Install opencv by:
pip3 install opencv-python

To use, just excute:
python3 image_visualizer.py [your file name]
